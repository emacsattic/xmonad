Integrate Xmonad and Emacs, creating an even more enjoyable environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an alpha release and still contains severe bugs.  Despite
it's limitations I already find it useful and hope that others will
too.

The first two bugs listed below are pretty severe.  I release this
package also in the hope that someone with a deeper understanding of
Xmonad and Haskell can help me with the first bug below.

Example configurations for Xmonad and Emacs can be found in the files
`xmonad.hs' and `emacs.el', which are distributed with this library.
You have to read those files and adjust your configuration accordingly,
before turning `xmonad-mode' on or strange things will happen.

Features:

* Instead of one minibuffer per frame a dedicated minibuffer frame
  is used which is placed at the bottom (or top) of the screen and
  is visible on all workspaces.

* When completing input in the minibuffer the *Completions* buffer is
  shown in a dedicated frame placed at one of the edges of the screen.
  Other X windows are resized to make room for that X window.  Once
  input is confirmed or aborted the frame is removed.

* `emonad', a bash script wrapper around emacsclient, allows using
  Emacs for purposes utilities like dzen, xmonad and dmenu are
  normally used for.

Bugs:

* After the completions frame is deleted frames sometimes fail to use
  all the available space.
* `emonad' fails to print anything to stout making it useless as
  a replacment for e.g. dmenu.
* Minibuffer frame sometimes loses focus when it shouldn't.
* Turning of Xmonad mode fails to add minibuffer windows to existing
  frames and remove default minibuffer frame.


Thanks and Best Regards,
